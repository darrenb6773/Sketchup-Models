# Sketchup-Models
Models I've mused over

## White Greenhouse.skp

Originally sourced from [Barn Greenhouse by Ana White](https://www.ana-white.com/woodworking-projects/diy-greenhouse]  via [13 Free greenhouse plans](https://www.thespruce.com/free-greenhouse-plans-1357126) (from her detailed set of plans and cut list, but no digital model) 

I removed a repeat off of the original design to make it fit my section (but haven't kicked off sourcing the materials and a temporary garden has taken up the ground space ) 

SKP file is fully dimensioned and checked for part collisions (within a few mm)
