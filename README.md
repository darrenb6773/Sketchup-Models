# Sketchup-Models
Models I've mused over

## White Greenhouse.skp

Originally sourced from [Barn Greenhouse by Ana White](https://www.thespruce.com/free-greenhouse-plans-1357126) (from her detailed set of plans, but no digital model) 

I removed a repeat off of the original design to make it fit my section (but haven't kicked off sourcing the materials and a temporary garden has taken up the ground space ) 

Original plans were only available as cut list and images. SKP file is fully dimensioned and checked for part collisions (within a few mm)
